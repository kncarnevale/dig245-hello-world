      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>Why are you taking this course?</h3>
      <p>I am taking this course to learn more about web design to see if I am interested in
        more front-end design in comparison to back-end.</p>

      <h3>What experience do you have creating content for the web or programming?</h3>
      <p>For the web, last semester I took Data Visualizations, where we made a website
        using D3.js. For programming, I am a computer science major, so I have a lot of experience
        in Python, Java, and C because of the courses I have taken at Davidson. In my internship
        this past summer at McDonald's Corporate, I also gained experience in Kotlin, while working
        on the front-end of their Android version of McDonald's Global App.</p>

      <h3>What are your goals in this course?</h3>
      <p>My goals for this course are to learn new technologies and become a more well-rounded
        programmer. I think this course will also help me gage my interest on whether or not
        I prefer designing versus just coding.</p>

      <h2>Learn-Computing Activities</h2>
      <h3>File Organization and Naming</h3>
      <p>In the File Organization and Naming learn-computing activity, I did, I learned how
        and why one would need a naming system to keep all their files organized. Some of the
        best naming practices are names that are descriptive and avoid abbreviations. When you
        make a new version of the same file, you must append a number or date to it, either using hyphens,
        underscores, or camelCase, so it is easier to find the version you are looking for. It is also good
        practice to structure all your folders in an organized way, so you never have any problems finding a file.
      </p>
      <h3>The Command Line</h3>
      <p>The other learn-computing activity I did was The Command Line. In this activity, I learned that
        the command line is a text interface in the computer. I also learned how to use the command line
        to navigate through directories and make new files in them.

      <h3>Hate With Friends</h3>
      <p>I really like this concept of connecting to a user's Facebook account and finding out
        if you have mutual friends that you dislike with people you follow. I think it is a very
        interesting concept that a lot of users would be interested in having.

      <h3>Rock-Paper-Scissors. You vs. The Computer</h3>
        <p>I am a huge fan of any type of game, and I love the idea of using artifical intelligence to
        play Rock-Paper-Scissors. It would be really cool to build something like this.

      <h3>Endless Horse</h3>
        <p>I love animals! This is cool how the creator designed an image of a horse and extended it on forever.
        It is interesting to think about how to creator probably used some type of endless for-loop to create this.
